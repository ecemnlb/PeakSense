🌟 Peak Deconvolution App for AA, DA, and UA 
This MATLAB app performs peak deconvolution of three analytes: Ascorbic Acid (AA), Dopamine (DA), and Uric Acid (UA) from voltammetric data. It includes baseline correction, peak detection, feature extraction, and machine learning-based concentration prediction using pre-trained models.


🛠️ Features:
📊 Interactive plotting of raw and baseline-corrected signals
🤖 ML-based prediction of peak positions, amplitudes, and variances
💉 Estimation of AA, DA, and UA concentrations using trained regression models
🖥️ User-friendly MATLAB App Designer interface
📂 Import custom CSV data and analyze with one click

🚀 Getting Started:
🔧 Requirements:
MATLAB R2020a or newer
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
